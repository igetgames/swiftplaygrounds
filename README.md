These are [Swift Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift/resources/) and [Playground Books](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/swift_playgrounds_doc_format/) that I've created or modified. See each directory for more information.

## Installation

Clone the repository and use the provided .playground directories directly or copy the provided .playgroundbook directories to your iOS device.

## Building

Playground Books are built using [playgroundbook](https://github.com/playgroundbooks/playgroundbook). You will need to use my [clone](https://github.com/igetgames/playgroundbook) as I rely on features not yet merged upstream.


## License

This repository is covered under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md). Original license files reside in the top-level directory of Playgrounds and Playground Books that were created under a different license.
